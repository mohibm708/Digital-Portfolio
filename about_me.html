      <h1>About Me <span class="decor">|</span></h1>
      <h2>Who's "Me?"</h2>
      <p>Hi. My name's Mohib, and I'm a junior in AHS, taking Computer Science II. I'm <u title="I was born on the 30th of October!">15 years old</u>, and I was born in Toronto, Canada, where I would then move throughout various cities in New Hampshire, before settling in Allen, Texas. When I started school in AHS, computer science wasn't a subject that I'd highly involved myself in, but if you were to somehow recover all the thumb drives and files I've made, used, and lost, there'd be a considerable amount of mainly useless programs, small text-based games, and even <u title="Spelling corrections.">mods</u> of games created by friends.</p>
      <h2>What makes a portfolio important?</h2>
      <p>My digital portfolio's important to me because with it, I can create a catalog, which will allow me and <u title="Such as, oh, I don't know, employers?">other people</u> to easily navigate throughout my past work and find an exact record of a project, assignment, or other type of media. Additionally, if a skill of mine becomes rusty, or I become unfamiliar with a certain topic, I can easily revisit it through this portfolio, and revitalize my memory of the concept at hand.</p>
