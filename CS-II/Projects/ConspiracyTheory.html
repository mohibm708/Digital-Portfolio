      <h2>The Basics of Recommendation Algorithms</h2>
      <p>Most recommendation algorithms collectively follow the same pattern of curating content based on how the user interacts with what they're given. The factors that an algorithm would take into account include:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>How long the user spends on a certain genre of posts</li>
	<li>Whether the user's interaction with types of posts is positive or negative (reporting/suggesting less/disliking in comparison to saving/sharing/liking)</li>
	<li>Whether the user interacts with a type of poster after seeing their post, and how (blocking, following)</li>
	<li>Interests of other people that the user shares a connection with ("[name] liked this", "[name] is following this user")</li>
	<li>Genre of content from users/hashtags that the user follows</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The trends in what genre of post that a user interacts with, alongside the rest of these factors can be "weaved" by the algorithm into a collection of predicted interests. This collection is then used to refine itself and appeal to users using more specific and personalized content.</p>
      <h2>The Feedback Loop</h2>
      <p>Explained by its name, the concept of feedback can be described as when the results given at the end of a loop's iteration are, to some extent, used as input in the next iteration. Two types of feedback loops exist: positive, in which a loop's results make themselves more intense, rapid, or prevalent across iterations, and negative, in which those results make themselves weaker, slower or less prevalent.</p>
      <p>For one example of positive feedback in social media, suppose a post about a new show that piques the interest of some everyman. Just as soon as the everyman likes the post (or even expands it!), the algorithm of the platform they use receives a signal to start displaying more posts related to the show. This will enhance the everyman's interest in the show, leading them to seeing and liking more posts about it as well as following more people who share an enjoyment in the show.</p>
      <p>To explain negative feedback, imagine that the everyman develops a distaste of the show after some unfortunate change, like a narrative turn or introduction of an actor that they dislike. This distaste will push them to make efforts to get the show off out of their suggested content, undoing the positive feedback's effect by unfollowing users, requesting less related content, or even just spending less time. Another unconsciously performed method can be the everyman "outnumbering" content by getting into something else, using a positive feedback loop to make the show less relevant <i>in comparison</i>.</p>
      <h2>Conspiracy Theories & Algorithmic Amplification</h2>
      <p>Many conspiracy theories are, by nature, highly outlandish and emotionally charged. Often consisting of heated claims about a large group's intentions or a string of odd events connected by some hypothetical underlying plot, conspiracy theories often play on heavy pathos ("How are you failing to notice this?") and the general lure of curiosity to gain readers. Thus, even despite initial disbelief existing, people will still be compelled to open posts, regardless of whether they're interested by the theory or simply by how unbelievable the theory sounds.</p>
      <p>One major flaw in recommendation algorithms is that they typically fail to account for how polarized views on a topic differ in their opinion &mdash; not in the attention they draw. Whether you dogpile on or idolize something you read on the internet, the more you interact with it, the more the algorithm will believe, "This is something that people should see." Conspiracy theories are best known for the drawn-out arguments they spark, meaning that their introduction to a social media platform would expansively inflate them across the internet, possibly to the point where said social media platform could be characterized for being the catalyst of a widespread discussion ("The controversy started with a post on...").</p>
      <h2>Platform Incentives</h2>
      <p>One strategy that many platforms roll out to their users is the ability to monetize their content. Placing ads throughout their videos or locking higher-quality content behind paywalls, users can collect more revenue if they can gain more engagement.</p>
      <h2>Potential for Exploitation</h2>
      <p>As a result of this fairly simple formula of "engagement makes profit," if a content creator knows how to catch attention effectively, they can craft "baits" which they can use to gain more interaction and money. Clickbait ("Casinos hate this, but can't stop you from doing it") and ragebait ("10 reasons why this thing is bad") are good for short-term boosts, but overall, interacting with an ongoing conspiracy theory may be one of the most effective ways to draw the attention of the world. Whether by making small comments about the situation or fully joining its bandwagon, content creators will stoke the fire by bringing it to the eyes of their audience primarily for the revenue, with little regard to the real-world effects of the conspiracy theory beyond a mere, "I don't condone the harassment of anyone involved in this."</p>
