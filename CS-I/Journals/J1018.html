      <br>
      <h2>EX.1:</h2>
      <p>Unlike an SR Latch, the D-type Flip Flop provides a short delay before latching outputs, which is vital for more human operators who tend to make errors more often. Additionally, the D-type is easier to use because it is controlled by just one input.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>EX.2:</h2>
      <p>The two inputs in the SR Latch function as "set" and "reset" inputs, each one setting and saving their own outputs. However, the D-type Flip Flop basically has one input that can be controlled. This input changes data, while the CLK signal saves that change into the final outputs.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>EX.3:</h2>
      <p>The inverter makes sure that the two AND gates never both receive identical inputs, which causes the forbidden state in the SR Latch.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
      <p>I learned how to create a memory-based circuit that is more advanced than a mere SR Latch: a D-type Flip Flop. The big idea of this lesson is understanding the <i>exact</i> purposes of inputs and outputs, as well as other components within circuits.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
      <p>Properly figuring out and explaining how the inputs of a D-type Flip Flop worked.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      <p>Explaining why forbidden states are forbidden.<sup><a href="#footnote1" id="reference1" title="I found out! It's because if the inputs of a circuit such as the SR Latch are both high or low, both outputs would (logically) be identical. Considering how both outputs are described as NOT the other, this shouldn't happen.">1</a></sup></p>
      <br>
      <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
      <p>With this lesson, I now know better ways of storing memory using circuits. Additionally, I now am better at figuring out the purposes of a circuit's components through experimentation.</p>
