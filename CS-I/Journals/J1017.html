      <h2>1.1:</h2>
      <p>The truth table of the AND gate.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.2:</h2>
      <p>The truth table of the XOR gate.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>2.1:</h2>
      <p>The first four rows of the full-adder's truth table are identical to the truth table of the half-adder.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>2.2:</h2>
      <p>This is true because in the first four rows of the full-adder's truth table, c<sub>in</sub> is 0, and in the truth table of the half-adder, c<sub>in</sub> does not exist and, in this case, is also 0.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>3.1</h2>
      <p>The least significant bit position is the smallest place value, and thus does not get any number carried into it.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>3.2</h2>
      <p>No, because each adder must wait for the previous one to send an output.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>3.3</h2>
      <p>It can be inferred that both A<sub>15</sub> and B<sub>15</sub> are both 1, meaning that the 17th bit would be 1. This state is called overflow.</p>

      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
      <p>I learned how to create basic circuits like the half-adder and the full-adder. The big idea of this lesson is understanding how the components of any circuit can be simplified using truth tables.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
      <p>Trying to make subscripts in HTML. (I didn't find many challenges, honestly.)</p>
      <br>
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      <p>This experience could be improved with interactive examples of each adder in Falstad, though I don't think there are built-in circuits for those.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
      <p>With this lesson, I have better honed my skills in canonical representation and the usage of gates to create common circuits.</p>
