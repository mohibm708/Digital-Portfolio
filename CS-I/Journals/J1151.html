      <h2>1.1:</h2>
      <p>Branching necessitates more code for every mentioned condition.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.2:</h2>
      <p>When the Boolean test is true, the following code is executed as a result, or consequently.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>2.1:</h2>
      <p>The first jump is conditional because it will only be executed given that 5 is greater than 4.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>2.2:</h2>
      <p>Ensuring that the code skips the alternative if the outcome does not enable it.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>2.3:</h2>
      <p>The alternative directly precedes nonconditional code, so there is no need to skip any more code blocks.</p>

      <img src="../../assets/images/flowcharts.png" width="972.9" height="1125.9" alt="Five flowcharts made in Draw.io. The first one describes the process of making a PB&J sandwich, the second one describes the processes of an automatic lamp, the third one describes driving at an intersection with stop signs, the fourth one describes driving at an intersection with traffic lights, and the fifth one describes taking a left turn at an intersection with traffic lights.">

      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
      <p>I learned the vocabulary of conditionals as well as the formatting of flow charts. The big idea of this lesson is the complexity caused when procedures branch based on certain events.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
      <p>I struggled a bit with creating flow charts in Draw.io, as well as with understanding what the jump mnemonics were comparing.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      <p>This lesson could incorporate examples of each conditional jump in the Assembly Language.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
      <p>With this lesson, I've acquired a better understanding of how conditionals can work, and I have also found a new tool to help map conditionals.</p>
