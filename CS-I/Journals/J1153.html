      <h2>1.1:</h2>
      <p>Although both loop repeat blocks of code, the repeat-while loop's first execution occurs unconditionally.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.2:</h2>
      <p>Once.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.3:</h2>
      <p>The jump redirects back to the test, since the consequent's execution means that the loop is still active.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>2.1:</h2>
      <p>No. In the case of a program that adds numbers and records how many are inputted until a non-numeric is submitted, using a repeat-while loops would cause the amount of numbers given to be at least 1 even if none are inputted.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>2.2:</h2>
      <p>No. In the case of a program that runs a turn-based game, all games end with at least 1 turn. A repeat-while's minimum of 1 ensures this.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
      <p>I learned the differences between while and repeat-while loops. The big idea of this lesson is visualizing the different uses of certain types of code blocks.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
      <p>I struggled with visualizing an exclusive use of the repeat-while loop.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      <p>The article could be better if it provided the outputs of while and repeat-while loops for the reader to compare and understand.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
      <p>This lesson has helped me with noticing the differences in the function of seemingly identical code blocks, as well as thinking about where each one could be used.</p>
