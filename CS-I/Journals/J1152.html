      <h2>1.1:</h2>
      <p>The test is executed to see if the variable fulfills the condition, and perform the loop if it still does. If it doesn't, the loop is skipped and the program ends.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.2:</h2>
      <p>Both the loop and the conditional use jumps and conditions to see if a variable still achieves a certain thing; however, the conditional performs in one direction while the loop moves back to the previous code block after altering the variable.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.3:</h2>
      <p>The jump after the consequent directs back to the test to continue the loop, since the consequent is what is performed if the condition is fulfilled.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
      <p>I leanred the fundamentals of a while loop, as well as how it is performed in raw machine code. The big idea of this lesson is understanding the nonlinearity of certain conditionals and types of code.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
      <p>I struggled with trying to explain how the jumps created the loop.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      <p>This lesson could also incorporate a section about exiting a loop, such as break functions.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
      <p>I now realize that the directions of pointers in code can change with loops and conditional blocks.</p>
