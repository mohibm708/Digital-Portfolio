      <br>
      <p>I received assistance from: Logic.ly</p>
      <br>
      <p>I assisted: No one</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.1:</h2>
      <p>While EQUAL is true when both inputs are true, XOR is false if both inputs are true.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>2.1:</h2>
      <p>The inputs determine the outputs, and for every input, there are 2 possibilities: it being true or false. As a result, with every input, the initial amount of possibilities is doubled.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
      <p>I learned the basic notation of Boolean algebra. The big idea of this lesson is understanding how each symbol of Boolean works, how to create truth tables to better understand it, and a comprehension of the Boolean order of operations.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
      <p>Understanding the IMPLY operations.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      <p>Incorporating visual aids to instill a better understanding of how each operation works, and how they work when combined.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
      <p>With this lesson, I am more capable of utilizing Boolean algebra in future programs to carry out new tasks under new conditions.</p>
