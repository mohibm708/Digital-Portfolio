      <h2><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2gmopqk9" target="_blank">Exercises: NOT, AND, OR, XOR, and NOR Gates Using NAND Gates</a></h2>

      <h2><a href="https://tinyurl.com/2mpw2bsm" target="_blank">Excursions: 7-Segment 4-Input LED Display</a></h2>

      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
      <p>I learned how to utilize DeMorgan's laws, as well as the functional completeness of NAND gates to create new gates. Additionally, during the excursion, I learned how to further use canonical representation to create functions. </p>
      <br>
      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
      <p>Some challenges I encountered were creating an XOR gate from NAND gates, as well as debugging the errors in my LED display after creating it.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      <p>Not having the excursion. (I'm kidding, I'm kidding!)</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
      <p>I'm much more confident in creating functions as big as or even larger than my excursion, and I'm also more prepared for creating with restrictions on things like gate types.</p>
