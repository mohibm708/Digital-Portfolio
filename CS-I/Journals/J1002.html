      <br>
      <p>I received assistance from: My older sister (requested anonymity)</p>
      <br>
      <p>I assisted: No one</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.1:</h2>
      <p>Two services I use are iMessage and Gmail.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>2.1:</h2>
      <p>Yes, since the chances of having a universally unique directory name are basically impossible.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>3.1:</h2>
      <p>Having a special symbol makes it easier to recognize and associate "~" with the home directory.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>4.1:</h2>
      <p>Yes, the prompt added the directory name to itself. This helps users understand where they are.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>5.1:</h2>
      <p>Each time the up arrow is pressed, the command prompt completes with the command above.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>5.2:</h2>
      <p>Each time the down arrow is pressed, the command prompt completes with the command below.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>6.1:</h2>
      <p>No, because I think the command was added to out.txt.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>7.1:</h2>
      <p>"ls" shows the contents of a directory, while "tree" shows the contents of a directory and its child directories.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>7.2:</h2>
      <p>"tree" is more detailed; however, "ls" is better when there's too much detail. (i.e. extremely deep directories, too many files)</p>
      <br>
      <h2>8.1:</h2>
      <p>The argument to sleep specifies the duration of the command.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>8.2:</h2>
      <p>Yes, because if I input a sleep command with a higher or shorter number, the command will execute for the corresponding time. For example, if I input "sleep 5," the command executes for 5 seconds. If I input "sleep 10," the command executes for 10 seconds.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>9.1:</h2>
      <p>The command prompt doesn't disappear.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>9.2:</h2>
      <p>Running a job in the background means to run it without it affecting the command prompt.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>9.3:</h2>
      <p>The number in the brackets specifies the job number, out of the amount of already running jobs.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>10.1:</h2>
      <p>I can see 3 jobs.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>10.2:</h2>
      <p>This is a list of jobs that I inputted.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea?"</h2>
      <p>I learned how to use and navigate the shell. The "big idea" of this experience is an understanding of how Bash functions, and (briefly) the knowledge of what makes a GUI different from a CLI.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
      <p>Remembering the difference between commands to remove a directory and a file.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      <p>Specifying how to rename a directory.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
      <p>Because of what I've learned, my problem-solving skills on the terminal have enhanced because I now can use basic commands to navigate throughout it.</p>
