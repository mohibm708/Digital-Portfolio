      <p>I received assistance from: No one</p>
      <br>
      <p>I assisted: No one</p>

      <h2>1.1:</h2>
      <p>Add two digits together, and if the result is too big to be defined as one digit, the larger number is added to the next set of digits.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>2.1:</h2>
      <p>The base, meaning that no sum can exceed 7 and still be one digit.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>3.1:</h2>
      <p>The base, meaning that no sum can exceed F, or 15, and still be one digit.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>4.1:</h2>
      <p>The base, meaning that no sum can exceed 1 and still be one digit. 2 is the 10 of binary system, which is why 1 + 1 = 10.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
      <p>I learned how to add numbers in other bases. The "big idea" of this lesson is visualizing the number lines of nondecimal bases.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
      <p>I struggled with understanding 1 + 1 = 10.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      <p>The exercise could incorporate the number lines of other bases in order to help instill a better understanding of what is 10 in things like binary and octal.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
      <p>With what I've learned, my ability to understand the nature of bases below and above 10 have improved.</p>
