      <h2>1.1:</h2>
      <p>Git is communicating the latest commits, including their authors and the date they were committed.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.2:</h2>
      <p>Both the log and the latest commit have the same message: "Adding our first file in this tutorial"</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.3:</h2>
      <p>This is the commit message, and thus a vital part to record in the log.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>2.1:</h2>
      <p>file1.txt is noted as not staged, while file2.txt is noted as untracked.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>2.2:</h2>
      <p>This is because while file1.txt was being tracked by Git, it was modified. However, file2.txt was never tracked by Git, because it was just created.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>3.1:</h2>
      <p>file1.txt is noted as modified, while file2.txt is noted as a new file.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>3.2:</h2>
      <p>They are the same color, but file1.txt was edited while being tracked, while file2.txt was edited before being tracked.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>4.1:</h2>
      <p>Two files.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>4.2:</h2>
      <p>Text additions are noted by green lines of text beginning with +'s. While the two versions of file1.txt are called a/file1.txt and b/file1.txt, the two versions of file2.txt are called /dev/null and b/file2.txt.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>5.1:</h2>
      <p>Nothing, because no new files were added.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea?"</h2>
      <p>I learned how to use Git and how to use commands like add, status and commit.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
      <p>Coming up with a good commit message.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      <p>Explanations on what some of the contents of commands mean.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
      <p>With this lesson, I now have an understanding of how to use Git to my advantage, like keeping multiple versions of my files and directories.</p>
