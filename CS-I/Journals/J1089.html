      <h2>1.1:</h2>
      <p>It's usually the first thing taught because it's simple enough to understand, but additionally familiarizes learners with printing functions, which are highly essential for programmers.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.2:</h2>
      <p>Some programming languages need the Hello World argument to be enclosed in parentheses, like Python and Swift, while others may need it to be both prefixed and suffixed, like HTML.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
      <p>I learned the history of the Hello World program. The big idea of this lesson is understanding the first steps taken to enter the field of programming.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
      <p>I faced challenges during the Merlin Mission as I tried to write a Hello World program in the Assembly Language.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      <p>Although it only documented information about the Hello World program, I do feel like the page could be a bit longer.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
      <p>Reflecting on this lesson, I believe the first program I wrote being a Hello World program had a big impact on my path as a learning programmer.</p>
