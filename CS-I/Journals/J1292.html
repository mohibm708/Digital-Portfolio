      <h2>1.1.1:</h2>
      <p>After 5 runs, 100 darts returned &#960;-estimates of 3.16, 3.28, 3.24, 3.36, and 3.12.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.1.2:</h2>
      <p>After 5 runs, 1000 darts returned &#960;-estimates of 3.228, 3.128, 3.164, 3.204, and 3.124.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.2:</h2>
      <p>The estimates from 1000 darts are more specific than the estimates from 100 darts.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.3:</h2>
      <p>If N is 10000, the program will usually return values with five significant figures (i.e. 3.1528, 3.148, 3.1132, 3.1532 and 3.1396).</p>
      <br>
      <h2>1.4:</h2>
      <p>If the darts are deliberately thrown outside or inside the circle, the &#960;-estimate will (respectively) be lower or higher than the actual value. If the darts are thrown purely randomly, the alignment of the estimate with &#960; is completely dependent on the probability that a dart will land within the circle (the ratio of the circle and square's areas multiplied by 100; this is constantly ~78.53% given that the square's length and width are the circle's radius doubled).</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
      <p>I learned how to use random numbers to find a fundamental constant in math. The big idea of this experiment entails the further comprehension of randomization's importance.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
      <p>Thinking about how to devise &#960; without actually using it to construct the circle proved somewhat difficult until I realized that there were only a few components of the circle that were needed to sort dart positions.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      <p>I believe <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/m/UeqCG547">this simulation</a> or some alternative to it could help with understanding how making the estimate is done.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
      <p>I've got a better understanding of how to use randoms to my advantage, and will definitely use it in other Swift ventures.<!-- since we arent permitted to use PYTHON >:[[[ --></p>
