	<p>Technical Challenges: This week, I was considering the use of GitHub as a place to host our code, but I'm unsure of how familiar my partners are with using the software. I will probably try to fix this by suggesting the idea and helping them use Git if needed.</p>

	<p>Technical Challenges: This week, I was able to receive some advice to fix last week's problem with Curses &mdash; I had to use a shell created specifically for the library itself. When I cloned the repository into a test directory, the library was able to function without errors.</p>
	<p>Scheduling Challenges: I hadn't done much with the ISP, but with the ability to experiment with Curses, I will be able to utilize it to replace what we had developed in Python.</p>
	<p>Interpersonal Challenges: There were no interpersonal challenges between our team members.</p>

	<p>Technical Challenges: This week, I struggled with using the Curses library due to errors when I edited Package.swift to align with the GitHub documentation. Additionally, since my teacher had been out of the state during this week, I was unable to contact him for help.</p>
	<p>Scheduling Challenges: We did not have any time-based issues this week.</p>

	<summary><h2>13-Mar-2023: Week 10</h2></summary>
	<p>Technical Challenges: This week, we faced a major technical challenge due to the requisite that we build our ISP in Swift. This problem has a major impact because the progress that we made with the project involved Python-exclusive elements, which we will have to find alternatives to in the Curses library.</p>
	<p>Scheduling Challenges: We had ample time to contribute to and little issues with scheduling ISP work.</p>
	<p>Interpersonal Challenges: There have not been any problems between our members this week.</p>

	<p>Technical Challenges: This week, I did not have too many major issues in technical fields.</p>
	<p>Scheduling Challenges: I had trouble finding time to work on the ISP because I had to prepare for an SAT during the weekend and complete multiple large assignments before school started again. I will resolve this by trying to finish my work more quickly and efficiently.</p>
	<p>Interpersonal Challenges: I have not had any interpersonal challenges this week.</p>

	<summary><h2>27-Feb-2023: Week 8</h2></summary>
	<p>Technical Challenges: Although we have made progress in finding a place to collaborate and begin coding &mdash; that place being the previously mentioned Replit &mdash; with the third quarter coming to a close and work in other ISPs (apparently?) beginning, we had the displeasure of learning that they ideally should all be created in Swift. Shifting the (honestly minimal) code I've made in Python could prove difficult, because we wanted to incorporate certain external packages such as <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytimedinput/" target="_blank">pytimedinput</a> that are vital to proper gameplay. Since it doesn't seem like there are alternatives to every module we plan on using, we may have to try convincing our teacher to allow an exception for us.</p>
	<p>Scheduling Challenges: The close of the quarter, as well as the junior SATs and Friday's early release gave us lots of free time to work on the ISP, so there were little problems in terms of scheduling this week.</p>
	<p>Interpersonal Challenges: Replit's chat tool (and its feature that allows full discussions about highlighted blocks of code) will probably eliminate last week's problem with communications.</p>
      </details>
      <p></p>
      <details>
	<summary><h2>20-Feb-2023: Week 7</h2></summary>
	<p>Technical Challenges: This week, I wanted to find a platform to begin working on the ISP's code, and found a simple and efficient medium, Replit, which I pitched to the rest of my group on the brainstorm doc. One thing that irks me about the IDE, though, is the fact that by default, all REPLs are public and require payment to make private. I decided to rescind the suggestion for the time being, but some friends of mine &mdash; outside of my ISP team &mdash; have told me that regardless, Replit is still a fairly formidable medium for programming. I plan on continuing to search for other IDEs while weighing Replit's usefulness against its paid privacy.</p>
	<p>Scheduling Challenges: Troubles from other classes have been light this week, so there was little struggle for me in terms of scheduling.</p>
	<p>Interpersonal Challenges: I'm not entirely sure if all the team members are aware of the changes in the ISP docs, which may prove difficult in terms of communication. This will probably be alleviated by shifting discussion onto an actual messaging platform, and then appending agreed-upon details to the docs.</p>

	<summary><h2>13-Feb-2023: Week 6</h2></summary>
	<p>Technical Challenges: This week, there was not much progress on the project, aside from some work on the first segments. I believe this free time could have be used by me to program these first scenes.</p>
	<p>Scheduling Challenges: Aside from a few long term projects such as planning debates in English, I don't believe there was much that could have made ISP work difficult.</p>
	<p>Interpersonal Challenges: We have had no interpersonal problems this week.</p>

	<summary><h2>&nbsp;6-Feb-2023: Week 5</h2></summary>
	<p>Technical Challenges: This week, we discussed choices between Python game engines and how the project's assets would be made. However, we soon discovered that none of us were particularly skilled in creating assets to display the backgrounds of scenes. This issue may be circumvented by acquiring drawings and pictures through commission (if permissible) or using the ample time we have to practice.</p>
	<p>Scheduling Challenges: Finding time to work on the ISP proved difficult this week due to new Karel missions, the worst of which being "Gates Somewhere," as well as (in my case) a large amount of studying and work to be done for classes such as AP World History and Spanish. With the next units about to start, I believe there will be less work to do in the next week due to new units starting.</p>
	<p>Interpersonal Challenges: There have been no conflicts between us this week.</p>

	<summary><h2>30-Jan-2023: Week 4</h2></summary>
	<p>Technical Challenges: We continued discussing antagonist ideas this week, proposing new concepts and expanding on older ones by explaining how we could emulate their behavior through certain modules. We also set up a list of rules and guidelines to help filter out lesser concepts, so I believe we are zeroing in on our final choice.</p>
	<p>Scheduling Challenges: With the snow days this week, we had no problems with time at all.</p>
	<p>Interpersonal Challenges: We haven't had any problems between members this week.</p>

      <details>
	<summary><h2>23-Jan-2023: Week 3</h2></summary>
	<p>Technical Challenges: This week, we mainly discussed character design, specifically in terms of the more overarching antagonists. We had multiple ideas of they could be and what they could look like, and have not made a final decision on which one to follow yet.</p>
	<p>Scheduling Challenges: I faced scheduling challenges because I had too much work in other classes to substantially contribute to the project. I plan to overcome this in the future by managing my time more skillfully.</p>
	<p>Interpersonal Challenges: We have had no interpersonal challenges this week!</p>

	<summary><h2>16-Jan-2023: Week 2</h2></summary>
	<p>Technical Challenges: This week, I began practicing the code of the first section of our game, which utilized multiple conditionals and random numbers in certain ranges. It proved to be difficult because of the different outcomes of the player's choices, as well as understanding what I was even doing after getting back on a day-old train of thought. However, I did manage to complete the program, and it functions pretty well.</p>
	<p>Scheduling Challenges: Since the plot is in development, there have been little tasks this week. However, the basic events (like how the actual story begins) were noted in our document, so I was able to work on one of them as the program I made this week.</p>
	<p>Interpersonal Challenges: As far as I can tell, our team hasn't met any disagreements lately.</p>
      </details>
      <p></p>
      <details>
	<summary><h2>&nbsp;9-Jan-2023: Week 1</h2></summary>
	<p>Technical Challenges: This week, we were planning how the game would be set up, primarily in terms of what variables need to be incorporated into the code to create a storyline with multiple branches. However, we cannot fully complete this list yet, mainly because the game's exact plotline is still being planned, but the best solution to overcome this is to simply wait without pestering the members who are writing up the game's layout, until a broad summary of the story is achieved.</p>
	<p>Scheduling Challenges: Mentions of tasks has been fairly rare, since we've only started on the project. I'd say we're in the early stages of development where the game is first written up on paper &mdash; or in our case a Google Doc &mdash; instead of immediately being built up in the code editor. Speaking of Google Docs, that is what we're using to house our ideas and layout for the project. I personally would like to use something with more distinction between users, like possibly GitHub, but I assume we may be shifting to that platform later on.</p>
	<p>Interpersonal Challenges: So far as disagreements between members about things such as project direction, we haven't had any interpersonal problems at all this week!</p>

	<p>Development Engineer: Development engineers are responsible for playing a part in the development and improvement of new and existing products. This process is additionally influenced by the QA Engineer's results, since their performance reports are used to troubleshoot issues in models. Development engineers collect info related to target audiences and the current wants and needs of the people to understand what should be performed in order to create something appealing enough to maximize revenue and catch the attention of their clients.</p>
	<p>QA Engineer: QA (quality assurance) engineers are essentially the beta testers of products. They are one of the first to use a model, making sure to note as many issues and significant details in their reports, so that once the rest of the team receives it, they can use the details to make their work better. The primary objective of a person who acts in this role is to explore a product to its fullest extent, testing it against every circumstance they can think of.</p>
	<p>Project Manager: Project managers influence the project &mdash; obviously. The outcome of the general venture is dependent on their performance, because they are responsible for laying out the procedure, keeping the group updated, and making sure that there are no problems during development, either with the item or between those working on it. Project managers should be able to brainstorm ideas while also incorporating others, while also being able to remain calm and collected with the rest of the team.</p>
	<p>Product Manager: Product managers' main objective partially mirrors that of the project manager, except the latter is broadly focused on the project while the former is in charge of its general outcome &mdash; which is clearly the product. Martin Eriksson, the founder of ProductTank, describes product managers as lying between technology, business, and user experience, aspects that they need to consider in order to maximize the success of the product.</p>
