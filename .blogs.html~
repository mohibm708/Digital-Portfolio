	<summary><h2>5-May-2023: joooe biden. joooooe biden. jooe biden.</h2></summary>
	<p>im fairly unsure of government control over ais mainly cause of factors like sting operations being highly augmented as a result. maybe im wrong in saying this but the average person would be fairly anxious about who they encounter online is actually, yknow, human? but hey on the topic of ais its always a funny idea to see what ais think. so i asked chatgpt. of course it doesn't have opinions "as an AI language model" but it was intriguing to see what it had to say on the general topic. it noted that government control would help <i>reduce</i> propaganda, as if such stuff wouldn't be produced FOR the government, but it also said that it could slight innovation and restrict people's expression. both arguments kinda make a lot of sense but overall i really do not think joe biden is gonna do anything disagreeable with it. like if anything hed make some massive joke video about dark brandon. have you guys seen that video where he literally refers to him by name</p>

	<summary><h2>2-May-2023: don't byod</h2></summary>
	<p>i think its really stupid of them to enact that byod thing because bro. give me the chance i would literally smash this chromebook over my own exposed and shaved-bald head if it meant that i could use bar minimum a massive brick monitor from some retired ibm employee. the policies we already have can barely hold up especially when it comes to content moderation because oH MY GOD I DO NOT LIKE THE MODERATION SOFTWARE WE USE. THEY PUT SOME SORT OF CODE IN THSOE CONTENT WARNING REDIRECT PAGES THAT INJECTS ADREANALINE INTO YOUR BRAIN. ITS SO INSUFFERABLE WHY IS THE APPLICATION FORMATTED SPECIFICALLY FOR ANDROID PHONES DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW TO CREATE GRAPHICS FOR A CHROMEBOOK???? ASSIGN THAT DEVICE TO US DESPITE NOT EVEN KNOWING THAT YOURE PRESENTING YOUR POWERPOINT TYYPE APPLICATIONS ON THEM WHAT AMNESIACS ARE YOU ON</p>
